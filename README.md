# BPS Fan PCB

## Purpose
This board is meant to be a passthrough to control fans from the [BPS Leader Board](https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-LeaderPCB). Since it is just digital control, it can also be used to control other digital peripherals, such as contactors, however, it cannot read digital inputs. The traces are sized for 1.5A at 25C increase in temperature.

## Connectors
* One 6 Pin Connector (+12V, GND, 4 Fan Control Pins)
* Twelve 2 Pin Connector (+12V, GND)

## Lights
* One LED that turns on when Power is connected to board
